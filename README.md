🌦 Weather Prediction App

A project developed as part of my 10-day Add-on Course on Microsoft Azure AI-102

This is a simple Python-based Weather Prediction / Weather Fetching App that retrieves real-time weather information using an external API. It demonstrates API integration, JSON handling, and basic data processing — foundational skills for building intelligent cloud-powered solutions.

🚀 Features

🌍 Fetches real-time weather data

📡 Uses API requests to gather information

📊 Displays temperature, humidity, weather condition, etc.

🧠 Good practice project for Azure AI-102 concepts

🐍 Fully implemented in Python

⚡ Lightweight and easy to extend

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Requests (for fetching API data)

JSON parsing

Weather API (OpenWeatherMap or similar)

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayushi-ninja/Weather-prediction-app.git
cd Weather-prediction-app

2️⃣ Install dependencies

If you have a requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Or install manually:

pip install requests

3️⃣ Add your API key

Inside weather.py, replace the placeholder API key with your actual API key (e.g., from OpenWeatherMap).

4️⃣ Run the script
python weather.py

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

How to call external APIs using Python

How to handle JSON responses

How to extract meaningful data from an API

Core concepts relevant to Azure AI-102, such as:

Working with data

Using APIs in intelligent applications

Preparing for cloud-based deployments

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was created as part of my 10-Day Add-on Course on Microsoft Azure AI-102, focusing on building foundational AI/ML capabilities and understanding how intelligent systems consume data from APIs.

📌 Future Improvements

Add a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt

Create a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Deploy to Azure Web App

Add charts for temperature trends

Integrate Azure Cognitive Services for voice input/output
